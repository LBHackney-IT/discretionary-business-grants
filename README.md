This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

#### Setup the database

1. Create the database
   ```bash
   createdb dbg
   ```
2. Run all migrations
   ```bash
   npm run dbmigrate up
   ```
3. Add the database URL as an environment variable in `.env`. On Linux you may need to provide a username and password.
   ```bash
   cat <<<EOF >> .env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/dbg
   EOF
   ```

#### Seeding the database

To seed your database with data to get going quickly, you can run the file under `db/seeds.sql` by doing the following:

```bash
cat db/seeds.sql | psql dbg
```

## Applying database migrations

Database migrations are managed with [db-migrate](https://github.com/db-migrate/node-db-migrate). To create a new migration

```bash
npm run dbmigrate create description-for-your-migration
```

This will create an up and down migration as sql files in `db/migrations/sqls` as well as a javascript file in `db/migrations` to run the sql files.

Migrations are run with

```bash
npm run dbmigrate up
```

Migrations can be rolled back with

```bash
npm run dbmigrate down
```

You can do a dry-run to view the changes that will be applied without making any changes (for both up and down migrations)

```bash
npm run dbmigratedry up
```
