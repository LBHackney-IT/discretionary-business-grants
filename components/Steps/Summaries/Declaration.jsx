          <strong>Covid 19 Temporary Framework Scheme</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the outbreak of the Coronavirus, the European Commission has
          approved schemes to aid businesses affected by the Coronavirus
          outbreak on the basis of their Temporary Framework, including the
          COVID-19 Temporary Framework scheme for the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          The maximum level of aid that a company may receive is €800 000 (€120
          000 per undertaking active in the fishery and aquaculture sector or
          €100 000 per undertaking active in the primary production of
          agricultural products). This is across all UK schemes under the terms
          of the European Commission’s Temporary Framework. The Euro equivalent
          of the Sterling aid amount is calculated using the Commission exchange
          rate applicable on the date the aid is offered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any aid provided under this scheme will be relevant if you wish to
          apply, or have applied, for any other aid granted on the basis of the
          European Commission’s Temporary Framework. You will need to declare
          this amount to any other aid awarding body who requests information
          from you on how much aid you have received. You must retain evidence
          of state aid for four years after the conclusion of the UK’s
          transition from the EU and produce it on any request from the UK
          public authorities or the European Commission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aid may be granted to undertakings that were not in difficulty (within
          the meaning of Article 2(18) of the General Block Exemption
          Regulation) on 31 December 2019, but that faced difficulties or
          entered in difficulty thereafter as a result of the COVID19 outbreak.
        </p>
        <p>
          This aid is in addition to any aid that you may have received under
          the De Minimis regulation allowing aid of up to €200,000 to any one
          organisation over a three fiscal year period (i.e. your current fiscal
          year and previous two fiscal years), and any other approved aid you
          have received under other State aid rules, such as aid granted under
          the General Block Exemption Regulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          By ticking the declaration below you are confirming eligibility, in
          principle, for aid.
        </p>
        <p className="govuk-hint">
          Businesses are eligible for grants under the EU State Aid De Minimis
          rules or the COVID-19 Temporary Framework for UK Authorities. The
          Discretionary Grant is considered State Aid and Local Authorities have
          a discretion to make payments to eligible recipients under either the
          De Minimis rules or the COVID-19 Temporary Framework for UK
          Authorities (provided all the relevant conditions are met). London
          Borough of Hackney will be issuing payments of up to and including
          £10,000 which can be provided under the De Minimis rules. Applicants
          are advised to check their position before submitting applications
          here.
