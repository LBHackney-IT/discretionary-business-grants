        <strong>Covid 19 Temporary Framework Scheme</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the outbreak of the Coronavirus, the European Commission has
        approved schemes to aid businesses affected by the Coronavirus outbreak
        on the basis of their Temporary Framework, including the COVID-19
        Temporary Framework scheme for the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        The maximum level of aid that a company may receive is €800 000 (€120
        000 per undertaking active in the fishery and aquaculture sector or €100
        000 per undertaking active in the primary production of agricultural
        products). This is across all UK schemes under the terms of the European
        Commission’s Temporary Framework. The Euro equivalent of the Sterling
        aid amount is calculated using the Commission exchange rate applicable
        on the date the aid is offered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any aid provided under this scheme will be relevant if you wish to
        apply, or have applied, for any other aid granted on the basis of the
        European Commission’s Temporary Framework. You will need to declare this
        amount to any other aid awarding body who requests information from you
        on how much aid you have received. You must retain evidence of state aid
        for four years after the conclusion of the UK’s transition from the EU
        and produce it on any request from the UK public authorities or the
        European Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aid may be granted to undertakings that were not in difficulty (within
        the meaning of Article 2(18) of the General Block Exemption Regulation)
        on 31 December 2019, but that faced difficulties or entered in
        difficulty thereafter as a result of the COVID19 outbreak.
      </p>
      <p>
        This aid is in addition to any aid that you may have received under the
        De Minimis regulation allowing aid of up to €200,000 to any one
        organisation over a three fiscal year period (i.e. your current fiscal
        year and previous two fiscal years), and any other approved aid you have
        received under other State aid rules, such as aid granted under the
        General Block Exemption Regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        By ticking the declaration below you are confirming eligibility, in
        principle, for aid.
      </p>
      <p className="govuk-hint">
        Businesses are eligible for grants under the EU State Aid De Minimis
        rules or the COVID-19 Temporary Framework for UK Authorities. The
        Discretionary Grant is considered State Aid and Local Authorities have a
        discretion to make payments to eligible recipients under either the De
        Minimis rules or the COVID-19 Temporary Framework for UK Authorities
        (provided all the relevant conditions are met). London Borough of
        Hackney will be issuing payments of up to and including £10,000 which
        can be provided under the De Minimis rules. Applicants are advised to
        check their position before submitting applications here.
